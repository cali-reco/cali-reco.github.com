{"name":"CALI","tagline":"A Software Library for Calligraphic Interfaces","body":"**CALI** is a software library for the development of Calligraphic Interfaces (intelligent interfaces based on sketches and gesture interaction) centered mainly on a simple **Shape Recognizer**.\r\n\r\nThis recognizer is a fast, simple and compact approach to identify Scribbles (multi-stroke geometric shapes) drawn with a stylus on a digitizing tablet. Our method combines temporal adjacency, Fuzzy Logic and geometric features to classify scribbles.\r\n\r\nThis algorithm recognizes elementary geometric shapes, such as Triangles, Rectangles, Diamonds, Circles, Ellipses, Lines and Arrows, and some gesture commands, such as, Delete, Cross, WavyLine, Move, Copy and Tap. Shapes are recognized independently of changes in rotation, size or number of individual strokes. \r\n\r\nThe recognizer has a **recognition rate of 97%** and a fast response characteristic making it very usable in interactive applications. \r\n\r\nThe library is written in standard C++.  \r\nCurrently it compiles under GNU g++ (Linux) and Visual C++ (Windows).\r\n\r\nThe source code and documentation is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License. \r\n \r\n\r\n###Comments?
